# The Archive of the Unsung ‚Äî Shelved Resources

A place for all the things you've built, tuned, configured ‚Äî and then moved on from. This repository is a carefully structured time capsule for **unused, paused, or decommissioned services**, ensuring their resources are never truly lost.

Much like a library stores retired manuscripts or a museum preserves tools of a bygone era, this repo safeguards Docker Compose files, configuration templates, service-specific data, and custom scripts from being deleted or forgotten ‚Äî even if they‚Äôre not part of your current stack.

> üîí _This is the place where ‚Äúdelete‚Äù is replaced by ‚Äúarchive.‚Äù_

## What This Repository Is

- A **centralized archive** for unused services, settings, and system files.
- A **clean workspace** to preserve prior work without cluttering active codebases.
- A **structured resource vault** ‚Äî nothing in-use, everything still valuable.
- A place to **look back**, reuse, reference, or resurrect projects as needed.

Each orphan branch is a standalone snapshot of a specific project or service that was once useful and may be again.

## Philosophy: "Nothing Gets Deleted, Only Shelved"

This repository is not where active development occurs. Instead, it's a **persistent memory layer** ‚Äî storing what‚Äôs been put on hold, migrated away from, or rewritten.

Unlike conventional repositories, there‚Äôs no shared history between branches. Every branch here is independent, intentional, and isolated.

---

## Key Benefits

- **Preservation of work** ‚Äì Nothing is lost when you offload unused services.
- **Future-proofing** ‚Äì Need to revive an old stack? It‚Äôs all here.
- **Clean separation** ‚Äì Orphan branches provide total isolation, keeping the repo tidy.
- **Reduced mental overhead** ‚Äì Don't worry about where you saved that one `compose.yaml`.
- **On-demand usage** ‚Äì Clone or cherry-pick only what you need.
- **Safe from cleanup scripts** ‚Äì Avoid accidental deletion during production cleanups.

## Repository Layout

### main Branch

- Contains **only** this `README.md`.
- Serves as the entry point to understand the structure and purpose of the repo.

### Orphan Branches

Each orphan branch represents one archived service and contains its associated files and configurations.

| Pattern                   | Use Case                                                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/docker-compose.yaml`    | Simple service with a standalone compose file                         |
| `/my-service/files/*`     | Services with multiple supporting files or folders                    |
| `/my-service/config/*`    | Config directories, typically for complex setups like reverse proxies |
| `/env.sample`             | Example environment variables, where applicable                       |
| `/README.md` _(optional)_ | Brief explanation/context for archived content                        |

## Best Practices for Shelving

- ‚úÖ Use **descriptive branch names** matching the service or original repo.
- ‚úÖ Group related files under a folder if the service needs extra configs.
- ‚úÖ Include **`env.sample`** files if the service relies on environment variables.
- ‚úÖ Add comments in YAML/config files explaining **non-obvious configurations**.
- ‚úÖ **Redact all secrets** before shelving anything.
- ‚úÖ Avoid dumping unrelated or temporary files.

---

## Tips

- Use `git checkout --orphan <branch>` to create new archival branches.
- Add a short branch-local `README.md` if there's extra context worth keeping.
- Shelve services after major changes, migrations, or cleanups.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I restore a full service from this repo?**  
Yes ‚Äî most branches are plug-and-play or easily adapted.

**Q: Can I use this as a backup?**  
No ‚Äî this is not a runtime backup. Use it alongside but not instead of backups.

**Q: Is this secure for sensitive content?**  
No ‚Äî you must **redact** secrets and credentials before shelving content here.

**Q: Why orphan branches instead of folders or tags?**  
Orphan branches give:

- **Clean isolation**
- **Fast checkouts**
- **No risk of git history overlap**

## Final Words

This repo exists to **honor your past work**. Sometimes it takes just a glance at an old config to unblock a new idea, restart a retired service, or avoid repeating mistakes.

Treat this as your personal **museum of infrastructure**.
